Webdriver Manager.minimal

Questuions:
1. Remote webdriver - should we add it? looks very similar to LocalWebDriverFactory but has URL param in drivers' constructors
2. Grid webdriver - should we add it? it can be implemented in different ways for different companies/teams
3. WebdriverConfiguration class - review!
